# AllWize - Simple Master Example

Listens to messages on the same channel, data rate and CF and prints them out via the serial monitor.

You can enable AES128 encryption using the external 
Arduino CryptoLibs library by Rhys Weatherley.
To do so, pass the ALLWIZE_EXTERNAL_AES bluid flag and 
set the appropiate key in WIZE_ENCRYPT_KEY.

Always remember to connect the antenna before powering the board!
